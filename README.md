# Geometri
[DISCONTINUED] Minecraft mod to provide geometric building, uses ForgeGradle

This mod adds a block to Minecraft that renders as a geometric form (oval/ellipse). See the following animation (click to open gfycat):

I abandoned this project because of performance problems and general loss of interest in Minecraft-modding. If anyone wants to continue it feel free to do so. The mod itself is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Flaiker/Geometri/blob/master/LICENSE). FML and Forge have licenses of their own, they are included in the [licenses folder](https://github.com/Flaiker/Geometri/tree/master/licences).
